# String Conversion from A to B
You have a dictionary of words and two strings a and b .
How can one convert a to b by changing only one character at a time and making sure
that all the intermediate words are in the dictionary?
Example:
```
dictionary: {"cat", "bat", "hat", "bad", "had"}
a = "bat"
b = "had"
solution:
"bat" -> "bad" -> "had"
```
