What's a Neuronym?
e.g. L10n, is called a Numeronym of the word Localization,
where 10 stands for the number of letters between the first 'L' and the last 'n' in the word.
Generate all such possible Numeronyms for any given string (character array). for eg. for
"nailed" :
"n4d", "na3d", "n3ed" , "n2led", "na2ed", "nai2d"
e.g. for the word "batch"
"b3h" , "ba2h" , "b2ch" etc.
Print progressively longer strings, until there is a '2' in the permutations. There is no point of
going below 2, because that won't compress the string.
