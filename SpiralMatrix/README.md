# Print a Matrix in Spiral order

e.g.  
X Y A  
M B C  
P Q R  
  
Output: XYACRQPMB  
  
* This problem is less about logic, but more about careful index manipulation.
* Assume a full and valid matrix. No need to spend time validating the input.
* Matrix need not be square. It can be rectangular.
* Avoid recursion.
* Hint - It may be faster to write this, if you name your variables clearly. Instead of i,j,k,l etc, try naming them like row, col, start, end etc. That will also help your interviewer follow along
more easily.
