# Detecting cycle in a graph
Given a directed graph, check whether there is a cycle in it.
* There can be multiple cycles
* We don't need to print all the cycles. Just return a boolean true/false if there is/isnot
at least one cycle respectively

Both the above graphs have a cycle and should return true.
