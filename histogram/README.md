# Largest rectangle under a histogram
Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be
made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the
width is 1 unit.
For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 2, 6}.

The largest possible rectangle possible is 12 (see the below figure, the max area rectangle is highlighted in red).
