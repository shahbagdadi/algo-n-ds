#2D array search
Find a number in a sorted 2D array.
You're given a 2d array (N x M) where all the numbers (integers) in the array are in increasing
order from left to right and top to bottom. You're also given a target number, to be searched
inside the array. What is the best way to search and determine if a target number is in the
array?

Input = {  {1 , 4, 7,11,15},
           {2 , 5, 8,12,19},
           {3 , 6, 9,16,22},
           {10,13,14,17,24},
           {18,21,23,26,30}
           }
